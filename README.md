# IOT-BASED-WEATHER-STATION
Weather station is basicaly a system which is used to monitor the weather of the enviornment and in this project i have used Rain Module Sensor and DHT11.

Rain Module sensor is used to sense the density of rain. DHT11 is used to sense the temperature and humidity of the environment.

In this project i have used NodeMCU which is the heart of the system and wifi enabling makes its more special.

Blynk software is also used to send data from end product to the cloud and cloud send the data to all the authenticated user who needs that data.
